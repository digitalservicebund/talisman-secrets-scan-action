# Detect secrets with Talisman action

This action uses [Talisman](https://thoughtworks.github.io/talisman/) to scan the incoming (pushed) range of commits for accidentally added secrets and sensitive information. It mimics a pre-push hook for this, thus it works nicely with a local git hook in tandem, that is as a fallback, last line of defense.

## Example usage

```yml
steps:
  - name: Detect secrets with Talisman in incoming commits
    uses: digitalservicebund/talisman-secrets-scan-action@main
```

## Caveat

When using this along with the `actions/checkout@v5` step you'll need to configure it to avoid a too shallow clone:

```yml
- uses: actions/checkout@v5
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
```

Otherwise you may run into Talisman erroring out while it's trying to execute git with an invalid revision range:

```

```
